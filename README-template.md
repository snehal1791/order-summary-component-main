## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned and implemented 
- Flexbox, specifically that an element can be made a flex container with `display: flex` and all of its direct children will automatically be laid out as flex items.

  ```css
  .plan-info-summary {
    background-color: #F8F9FE;
    border-radius: 0.95rem;
    flex-flow: 1 1 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    align-content: center;
    margin-left: 8%;
    margin-right: 8%;
    padding: 0.5rem;
  }
  .plan-info-summary .music-icon,
  .plan-info-summary .price-change-btn {
      flex-flow: 1 1 15%;
  }
  .plan-info-summary .plan-price {
      flex-flow: 2 1 60%;
      align-self: center;
      color: var(--dark-blue);
  }
  ```

- Semantic HTML, that it includes usage of tags that provides meaning to different sections of the page, like below code snippets:

  - `<figure>`
    ```html
    <figure class="plan-info music-icon">
      <img src="images/icon-music.svg" alt="music icon"/>
    </figure>
    ```
  - `<section>`
    ```html
    <section class="order-summary-header">
      <h1>  Order Summary</h1>
      <p>You can now listen to millions of songs, audiobooks, and podcasts on any device anywhere you like!</p>
    </section>
    ```

### Continued development

I would continue to improve my current skills on Semantic HTML, Flexbox and would learn to incorporate accessibility to make sure application works properly with assistive devices.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Tutorial (CSS): Real Layout Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [Content Sectioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#content_sectioning) - This helped me for applying Semantic HTML5 to organize the contents of the application. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
=======
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for applying Flexbox to achive responsiveness. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
